# Adding bars to unit displays.
I want to add a health bar and a heat bar to the unit displays. I need to decide where/how they go
Probably damage on the right and heat to the left.

# Correcting Turn Display
I need to build a custom dialog window that has a scrollable text pane for the information display.

# How do I handle charges and DFAs?
## Easy Mode
Move next to the target, charge/dfa button activates (based on conditions), click and handle using dialog
## Hard Mode
Click the target, move is calculated up to adjacent to the target and the dialog pops up, handle the dialog
